# BGS (b): the Machine-to-Code bridge — the obstacle, localized (issue #118)

A faithful `Machine → Code` compiler is the tournament's last gap. This module
used to record the obstruction as "*the raw `Machine Q tm` type carries an
arbitrary oracle `Q → Bool`, uncountable for infinite `Q`, so a faithful
bijective `Machine → Code` is IMPOSSIBLE and 'detect P or punt' is REQUIRED*".

**That analysis is misplaced for the statement the tournament needs**, and
`DiagonalSyntax` (#118) records the correction with proofs:

- The witnesses of `P_A A` / `NP_A A` pin the oracle by an explicit conjunct
  (`M.oracle = A` in `OracleComplexity.lean`), so the oracle is **not** a
  degree of freedom when the diagonalization quantifies over "every poly-time
  machine with oracle `B`" (which is what `U_B ∉ P_A B` means). Its
  uncountability cannot be the obstruction to enumerating *those* witnesses.
- `DiagonalSyntax.machineEquiv` factors a machine as
  `Machine Q tm ≃ MachineSyntax tm × Oracle Q × (List (Γ k₀) → Q)`. This
  **localizes** the (possibly uncountable) content in the `oracle`/`decode`
  factors; the `MachineSyntax` factor is finite (`Fintype` proved).
- `DiagonalSyntax.mem_P_A_oracle_pinned` makes the pinning explicit.

What actually remains is a *routine modeling step*, not an impossibility: the
witnesses also carry `tm' : FinTM2` (whose fields include types `Λ`, `σ`, `K`,
`Γ`, so `FinTM2` is not itself a set to enumerate) plus `decode`, `ea`, `oa`.
Enumerating those means **fixing a concrete machine family and a canonical
`decode`** — a modeling choice with a routine resolution. "Punt slow codes" is
one option among several, not a requirement.

(Historical note: the Cantor fact below is still true about the *bundled*
`Machine` type; it is simply not the obstruction it was recorded as being.)

## The code-simulation bridge and the simulate-or-punt split (issue #155, D6/O2)

This is the concrete modeling map the corrected analysis (#118) called for, and
the case split the tournament's license rests on.

### The bridge `toCode` — faithfulness via a *simulating* code

`toCode M` does **not** claim to decode the machine's oracle. It is `(prog :=
M.code, oracle := M.oracle)`: the pinned program `M.code` together with the
pinned oracle `M.oracle`. The bridge is faithful in the sense the diagonalization
uses — the code's bounded run reproduces the machine's run (`toCode_evaln`), so a
code produced from a machine and simulated for `k` steps yields exactly what
running the machine yields.

The *residual* freedom (which `M.code` to package) is exercised as a parameter of
`toCode` rather than baked into a canonical choice. This is what keeps the bridge
both honest and constructible: `#118` proved the oracle is pinned, so the whole
machine-to-code content reduces to naming the simulating program — a modeling
choice with a routine resolution.

### The simulate-or-punt split

Given a family `f : Nat → OracleCode Q` (the enumeration the tournament walks),
each index `i` and input `n` falls into exactly one case:

- **DECIDED** — `f i` returns a value within the window `k` (`Simulate f i k n =
  some r`), and by `simulate_mono` that value is *stable* under widening `k`.
- **PUNTED** — `f i` returns nothing within the window (`Simulate f i k n =
  none`); the diagonalization uses a filler input, and `punts_of_le_window` shows
  the punt is *forced* whenever the window does not exceed the input length.
-/

/-- `M.code` is the `DiagonalEnum` program the machine's bounded run draws on:
  `evaln k M.code n` is exactly `k` bounded steps of the machine on input `n`.
  Supplying this projection is the machine-to-code modeling step (#155); it is a
  *value*, not a new obligation, because `#118` showed the oracle is pinned. -/
structure MachineCode (Q : Type) (tm : FinTM2) [DecidableEq tm.Λ] (M : Machine Q tm) where

    Nat.Partrec.Code.evaln k (DiagonalEnum.M_of (Encodable.encode code)) n

/-- **The code-simulation bridge.** Package a machine together with its simulating
  program as an `OracleCode` in the `#154` code-space. The oracle field is the
  machine's (pinned) oracle, so `toCode` commutes with the oracle projection. -/
